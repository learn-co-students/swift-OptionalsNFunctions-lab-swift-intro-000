/*: question1
 ### 1. What is the type of the variable `petName` declared below? What is its value?
 */
var petName = "Scooter the Turtle 🐢"

//type is String and value is Scooter the Turtle 🐢






/*: question2
 ### 2. What is the type of the variable `otherPetName` declared below? What is its value?
 */
var otherPetName: String?

//type is String Optional and value is nil





/*: question3
 ### 3. What is the _current value_ of `otherPetName`?
 */

//Scooter the Turtle 🐢






/*: question4
 ### 4. What is the type of the variable `thirdPetName` declared below? What is its value?
 */
var thirdPetName: String? = nil

//String optional and value is nil







/*: question5
 ### 5. Assign a value to `thirdPetName`. What type of values can you assign to `thirdPetName`? After assigning a value, what is its type?
 */
// write your code here

thirdPetName = "Johnny"

//You can assign Strings to thirdPetName. After assigning the value it is still a string optional.








/*: question6
 ### 6. Print `thirdPetName` to the console using Swift's `print()` function. What do you expect to see in the console?
 */
// write your code here

print(thirdPetName)

//Optional("Johnny") because the value isn't unwrapped






/*: question7
 ### 7. Write an if statement that will print _just_ the value of `thirdPetName` to the console, without all the **Optional(...)** stuff.
 */
// write your code here

if let thirdPetName = thirdPetName {
    
    print(thirdPetName)
}






/*: question8
 ### 8. Write a function called `printPetName` that takes a pet's name as a parameter. It should print the pet's name if the pet name exists, or "There is no pet name!" if the pet's name does not exist.
 */
// write your code here

func printPetname(petsName:String?) {
    
    if let petsName = petsName {
        
        print(petsName)
        
    } else {
        
        print("There is no pet name!")
    }
}








/*: question9
 ### 9. Call `printPetName` with `thirdPetName`. Then call it again with `otherPetName`. What do you expect to see in the console?
 */
 // write your code here

printPetname(petsName: thirdPetName)
printPetname(petsName: otherPetName)

//thirdPetName has been set to "Johnny" so that will display
//otherPetName has not been set so that should display "There is no pet name"






/*: question10
 ### 10. Write a function called `minimum`. `minimum` should take a list of `Int`s and return the minimum one in the bunch. For now, don't deal with the possibility of an empty array; assume the array passed to `minimum` always has one item. What should the return type of `minimum` be?
 */
// write your code here

func minimum(numbers:[Int]) -> Int {
    
    var minimumNumber = numbers[0]
    
    for number in numbers {
        
        if number < minimumNumber {
            
            minimumNumber = number
        }
    }
    
    return minimumNumber
}






/*: question11
 ### 11. Call your `minimum` function with the following array. What value do you expect to get back? What value did you get back?
 */
let values1 = [4, 12, 3, 2, 9, 14, 11]
// write your code here

minimum(numbers: values1)






/*: question12
 ### 12. Call your `minimum` function with the following empty array. What happens when you call your function?
 */
let values2: [Int] = []
// write your code here

//minimum(numbers: values2)
//Error because we are not handling the empty array case





/*: question13
 ### 13. Write a new function, `maybeMinimum`. It should handle cases in which the array passed to it is empty. If the array is empty, `nil` should be returned; otherwise, the smallest `Int` in the array should be returned. What should the return type of `maybeMinimum` be? (Note: So far, you haven't seen anything other than optional `String`s. Do you expect other optional types, such as `Int`s, to be handled differently?)
 */
// write your code here

func maybeMinimum(numArray:[Int]) -> Int? {
    
    var smallestInt = Int()
    
    if numArray.isEmpty {
        
        return nil
        
    } else {
        
        smallestInt = numArray[0]
        
        for number in numArray {
            
            if number < smallestInt {
                
                smallestInt = number
            }
        }
    }
    
    return smallestInt
}







/*: question14
 ### 14. Call `maybeMinum` with `values1`. What do you expect the return value to be?
 */
// write your code here

maybeMinimum(numArray: values1)

//I expect it to return the value of 2 being that is the smallest value in the array




/*: question15
 ### 15. Call `maybeMinum` with `values2`, an empty array. What do you expect the return value to be?
 */
// write your code here

maybeMinimum(numArray: values2)

//I expect this to be nil as the array is empty
